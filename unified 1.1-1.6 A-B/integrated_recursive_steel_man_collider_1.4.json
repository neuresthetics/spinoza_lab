  "description": "Integrated framework unifying TOESF (Theory of Everything So Far) path integral physics with Motion Law dynamics, embedded in a recursive logic gate steel man collider. Models idea refinement as trajectories on a Free Energy manifold, with logic gates as topological operations. Self-refines via recursion, bounded by coherence ≥0.95 and rigidity <0.12. Physics substrate bounds QG variance <1%. Synthesizes all major human physics laws as emergent from unified Z over U(1)^4 gauge fields (extended via Partanen/Tulkki). Incorporates feedback from external validators, self-application, and tool verifications for precision. Date: 2026-01-01.",
