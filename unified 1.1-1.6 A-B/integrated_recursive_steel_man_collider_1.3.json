  "description": "Integrated framework unifying TOESF (Theory of Everything So Far) path integral physics with Motion Law dynamics, embedded in a recursive logic gate steel man collider. Models idea refinement as trajectories on a Free Energy manifold, with logic gates as topological operations. Self-refines via recursion, bounded by coherence ≥0.95 and rigidity <0.12. Physics substrate bounds QG variance <1%. Synthesizes all major human physics laws as emergent from unified Z over U(1)^4 gauge fields. Incorporates feedback from external validators (Gemini, DeepSeek) and self-application for enhanced precision, derivation explicitness, and Gödel-compliant recursion. Date: 2026-01-01.",
