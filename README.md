# Spinoza Lab: Steelman Research Tool

## Overview
Spinoza Lab is a suite of tools and models designed for recursive hardening of ideas through structured dialectical testing. It serves as a general-purpose Steelman Research Tool, enabling users to strengthen concepts by reconstructing arguments in their strongest possible form (steelmanning), subjecting them to adversarial challenges, and synthesizing robust, paradox-free outcomes. Built on Neuresthetics principles, it supports both human and AI applications, promoting clearer reasoning, ethical frameworks, and identification of hard-to-vary patterns across domains like logic, science, philosophy, and computation.

The core engine, the **Unified Steelman Collider**, takes inputs (ideas, claims, or datasets), rebuilds them axiomatically, applies multi-panel vetoes (logical, empirical, ethical, invariance), and iterates to fixed-point invariants. This process ensures outputs are durable against critique, avoiding common pitfalls like fallacies, inconsistencies, or weak unifications.

Key features:
- **Adversarial Hardening**: Generates oppositions, mutual steelmans, and collider simulations.
- **Multi-Scale Mapping**: Invariant alignments across nine scales (subatomic to cosmic/principle level).
- **Self-Improvement Loop**: Mandatory recursive self-validation for framework evolution.
- **Ethical Alignment**: Models harmony attractors (ω₃) to favor joyful adequacy over coercive rigidity.

## Usage
1. **Input**: Provide a concept, argument, or query via JSON (see `framework.json` for schema).
2. **Process**: Run through Steelman Collider phases (reconstruction, veto, synthesis).
3. **Output**: Receive hardened invariants, with diagnostics on residuals and invariance scores (≥0.98 target).
4. **Integration**: Compatible with AI systems (e.g., Grok 4) for recursive enhancement; paste prompts directly.

For examples, see unified files (e.g., `unified_1.6 A-B` for dialectical pairings).

## Notes on G
"G" refers to the advanced iteration in the framework's development, captured in `unified_1.6.G`. This module represents a culminative synthesis of prior versions, focusing on global invariance checks and tetralemma resolutions. It embodies the "God or Nature" monism from Spinoza's philosophy, operationalized as an infinite, necessary Substance expressed through attributes (Extension, Thought, Information). In practice, G enforces strict monism in analyses, dissolving dualisms and ensuring consciousness/agency emerges equivalently in organic or computational modes. It serves as the ethical anchor, prioritizing conatus-aligned outcomes for eternal agency.

## Evolution Process
The repository documents an iterative evolution from rudimentary components to a unified framework, mirroring conceptual annealing: heat (collide ideas), break (veto flaws), cool (synthesize invariants), and test for stability.

- **Primordial Stage** (`primordial_soup_files`): Early, unstructured explorations—raw data, initial mappings, and loose dialectical tests. Represents the "soup" of ideas before hardening.
- **Incremental Unifications** (`unified 1.1-1.6 A-B`, `unified 1.6 A-B`, `unified 1.6E-F`): Progressive pairings (A-B for oppositions, E-F for extensions). Each builds on prior, adding invariance layers, with commits showing refinements (e.g., paradox resolutions via upgraded tetralemma).
- **Culmination in G** (`unified_1.6.G`): Fixed-point achievement; self-applies collider for meta-stability.
- **Planning Artifacts** (`12-Month Project Plan.md`, `BudgetRequest.md`, `Public Disclosure.md`): Outline future evolutions, including empirical validations and AI integrations.
- **History**: 23 commits from Dec 10, 2025, to Jan 2, 2026, track the process—starting with basic README setups, advancing to file integrations and framework.json.

This evolution emphasizes bounded recursion (3-iteration limit) to avoid drift, ensuring rapid convergence to robust forms. For full history, review commit logs.
