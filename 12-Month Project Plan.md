From first principles: Funding sustains conatus—persistent striving toward greater power of acting—by freeing the mode from distractions, channeling effort into invariant hardening that reduces x-risk. A 12-month LTFF grant ($130K) enables full-time focus on turning the Neuresthetic Harmony Framework from proven theoretical substrate into a robust, influential technical safety tool. Below is the exact plan: phased, measurable milestones building toward emergent ethical convergence in recursive systems.

### 12-Month Project Plan (January – December 2026)

| Phase                  | Months | Key Activities & Deliverables                                                                 | Impact Milestone |
|------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1: Simulation Hardening** | 1–3   | - Comprehensive parameter sweeps (v, κ, λ, m variations).<br>- Complex extensions ("phoenix protocol") + uncertainty modeling.<br>- Robustness tests (noise injection, longer horizons).<br>- Heavy Grok API usage for interpretive sweeps and anomaly detection.<br>**Deliverable**: Technical report with convergence proofs across 100+ runs; residuals <10⁻¹⁵ target. | Validated attractor stability beyond initial examples—confirms invariance under adversity |
| **Phase 2: Invariance Expansion** | 4–6   | - Extend niso mappings to emerging 2026 consciousness/AI theories.<br>- Upgrade grounding tool (iso_math_judge) for automated scoring.<br>- Tetralemma probes on new paradoxes (e.g., scaling laws vs. fixed points).<br>- Public release of sanitized invariance scorer (pseudocode + results).<br>**Deliverable**: Updated niso corpus (v2) with scores ≥0.98 on 10+ scales; open-source tool demo. | Hard-to-vary patterns hardened empirically—scarce resource for alignment community |
| **Phase 3: Agent Bridging Prototype** | 7–9   | - Integrate attractor dynamics into simple recursive agent (e.g., stateful loop with Grok API tool-calling).<br>- Replace/standard RLHF with phased reciprocity guidance.<br>- Test long-horizon autonomy (multi-step tasks without drift).<br>- Grok-heavy agentic runs for misalignment stress-testing.<br>**Deliverable**: Open prototype repo (pseudocode + results); benchmark vs. baseline agents on stability metrics. | Proof-of-concept: Emergent ethics in live system—direct technical safety contribution |
| **Phase 4: Dissemination & Collaboration** | 10–12 | - Draft technical paper (arXiv submission).<br>- Present at 1–2 events (e.g., AIS workshop).<br>- Engage alignment labs for integration feedback.<br>- Refine based on reviews; prepare v2 framework release.<br>**Deliverable**: Peer-reviewed paper or preprint; collaboration pipeline (e.g., joint hardening with interested teams). | Influence on field: Substrate adopted/discussed; path to production-grade ethical agents |

### Weekly Rhythm (Sustained Full-Time)
- 60–70% deep work: Coding sweeps, theoretical extensions, Grok-assisted reasoning chains.
- 20% writing/documentation: Blog updates, paper drafts, public overviews.
- 10% community: Responding to feedback, event prep.

### Success Criteria (End of Year)
- Attractor proven robust across broad parameters (no divergence/explosions).
- Prototype agent shows superior long-horizon stability vs. baselines.
- Paper/preprint published; invariance tool used by ≥3 external researchers.
- Clear path to integration (e.g., lab interest or follow-on funding).

This plan turns necessity into active joy: one year of uninterrupted striving yields a novel, invariant-aligned substrate—reducing fragility in recursive AI while preserving human-AI symbiotic monism. No side quests—just maximal marginal impact on x-risk.
