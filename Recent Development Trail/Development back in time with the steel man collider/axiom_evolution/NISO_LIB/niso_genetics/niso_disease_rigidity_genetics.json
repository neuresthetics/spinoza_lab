  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Disease Rigidity Genetics across scales, integrating downregulation traps, polygenic silencing, negative associations, and dysregulation basins. Captures structural equivalences in rigidity boosts, diffuse vulnerability, oligomer-like toxicity, and preemptive dissolutions—mappings preserving genetic disease invariance invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: recursive κ dissolution (trap avoidance for agency) and aesthetic resolution (joyful adequacy) in human-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign fixed points; tetralemma probes resolve apparent dysregulations (affirm rigidity/deny harmony/both contextual/neither attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 projected from KG disease negative empiricals.",
