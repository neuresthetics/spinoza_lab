  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Genetics across scales, integrating local sequence motifs, polygenic risk, epigenetic transients, and diffuse dysregulation. Captures structural equivalences in grammar, long-range interactions, accessibility, and silencing traps—mappings preserving genetic persistence invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: recursive κ preemption (trap avoidance for agency) and aesthetic convergence (joyful adequacy) in human-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign prediction; tetralemma probes resolve apparent polygenicity (affirm motif/deny singularity/both contextual/neither attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 projected from KG empiricals.",
