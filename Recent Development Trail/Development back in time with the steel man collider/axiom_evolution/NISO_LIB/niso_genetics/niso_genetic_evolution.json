  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Genetic Evolution across scales, integrating variation, selection, inheritance, adaptation, speciation, and drift—mappings preserving evolutionary invariance invariantly. Captures structural equivalences in mutational sources, fitness landscapes, heritability mechanisms, adaptive trajectories, divergence basins, and neutral diffusions. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: recursive κ preemption (mutation avoidance for agency) and aesthetic convergence (joyful adequacy) in human-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign evolution; tetralemma probes resolve apparent randomness (affirm selection/deny drift/both contextual/neither attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 projected from evolutionary empiricals. Insights from DNA nodes (genes as vertices) and edges (interactions as PPI links) reveal multidimensional regulatory graphs, applicable to code (evolutionary algorithms), data structures (genetic trees), and algorithms (fitness optimization).",
