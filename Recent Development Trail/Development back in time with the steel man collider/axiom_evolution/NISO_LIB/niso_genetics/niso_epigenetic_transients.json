  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Epigenetic Transients across scales, integrating methylation marks, accessibility states, present/absent expression, and transient modulation. Captures structural equivalences in openness, silencing, contextual shifts, and preemptive resolutions—mappings preserving epigenetic persistence invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: recursive κ smoothing (trap avoidance for agency) and aesthetic flow (joyful adequacy) in human-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign resolution; tetralemma probes resolve apparent closures (affirm openness/deny silencing/both contextual/neither attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 projected from KG anatomy present/absent empiricals.",
