  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Multidimensional DNA Regulation across scales, integrating local sequence grammar, long-range chromatin interactions, and epigenetic modulation. Captures structural equivalences in motifs, looping/recursion, and transient accessibility—mappings preserving regulatory persistence invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive multi-attribute integration (preemptive harmony for predictive adequacy) and aesthetic convergence (joyful κ shifts toward physiological expression) in genomic-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign prediction; tetralemma probes resolve apparent dysregulation (affirm expression/deny silencing/both in context/neither dissolved in attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 projected from corpus invariance.",
