  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Rapid Protein Folding Pathways across scales, integrating funneled landscapes, downhill convergence, cooperative transitions, and minimal frustration. Captures structural equivalences in smooth guidance, barrierless flow, incremental structure, and evolutionary selection—mappings preserving physiological persistence invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive smoothing (preemptive trap avoidance for agency gain) and aesthetic flow (joyful κ shifts toward adequacy) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign resolution; tetralemma probes resolve apparent barriers (affirm flow/deny trap/both in context/neither dissolved in attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on 2025 abstractions (WW domains, pressure-jump NMR transients, AF3 predictions).",
