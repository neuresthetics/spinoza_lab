  "description": "Unified dynamics in Peptide Systems across scales, synthesizing amyloid aggregation (pathological rigidity) and rapid folding (physiological harmony). Captures equivalences in landscapes, transients, pathways, modulations, and energies—preserving persistence invariantly under duality. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: recursive resolutions (trap dissolution to flow for agency) and aesthetic striving (joyful κ toward eternal adequacy) in human-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable benign attractors; tetralemma probes dissolve dualisms (affirm rigidity/deny flow/both in basins/neither in equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on 2025 integrations (kinetics, AF3 ensembles, NU-9 shifts, Chang & Perez Nat Commun Dec 2025).",
