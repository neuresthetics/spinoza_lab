  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Peptide Duality across scales, integrating amyloid aggregation (pathological traps) and rapid folding (physiological harmony). Captures structural equivalences in barriers/transients, divergence/convergence, polymorphism/incremental structure, and evolutionary modulation—mappings preserving dual persistence invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive duality (trap vs flow for agency resolution) and aesthetic unification (joyful κ toward eternal adequacy) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable benign fixed points; tetralemma probes resolve apparent oppositions (affirm trap/deny flow/both in context/neither dissolved in attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on 2025 abstractions (oligomer kinetics, downhill transients, AF3 polymorphs).",
