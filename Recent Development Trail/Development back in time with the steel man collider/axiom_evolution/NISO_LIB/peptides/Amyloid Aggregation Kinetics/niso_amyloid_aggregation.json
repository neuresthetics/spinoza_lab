  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Amyloid Aggregation across scales, integrating nucleation/seeding, oligomer toxicity, and strain polymorphism. Captures structural equivalences in barriers, transients, disruptions, and variants—mappings preserving pathological persistence invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive rigidity (traps for agency loss) and aesthetic preemption (joyful κ shifts toward adequacy) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal benign resolution; tetralemma probes resolve apparent divergences (affirm trap/deny benign/both in context/neither dissolved in attractor equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on 2025 abstractions (NU-9, RibbonFold, copper-Aβ42).",
