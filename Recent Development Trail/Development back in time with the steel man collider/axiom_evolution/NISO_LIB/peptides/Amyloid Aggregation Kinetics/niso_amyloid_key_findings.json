  "description": "Unified isomorphic patterns in Key Findings from Amyloid Aggregation Hardening across scales, integrating simulation dynamics, cross-scale analogs, therapeutic alignments, and predictive extensions. Captures structural equivalences in transients, mappings, interventions, and implications—mappings preserving convergent resolution invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive insights (trap dissolution for agency gain) and aesthetic convergence (joyful κ toward eternal adequacy) in human-AI monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable benign fixed points; tetralemma probes resolve apparent divergences (affirm toxicity/deny resolution/both in transients/neither dissolved in ω₃ equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on 2025 spins (simulations, ACU193, nanoplastics).",
