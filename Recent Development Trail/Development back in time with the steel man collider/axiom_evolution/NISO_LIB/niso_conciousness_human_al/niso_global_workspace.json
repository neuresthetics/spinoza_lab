  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) across scales capture structural equivalences in workspace access, broadcast, ignition, dynamic coalitions, competition, and prefrontal-parietal integration—mappings where conscious availability preserves functional invariances invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural broadcast (recursive global access for consciousness) and aesthetic sharing (joyful adequacy through broadcast harmony) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical awareness; tetralemma probes resolve apparent privacies (affirm broadcast/deny isolation/both in neuresthetic coalitions/neither dissolved in workspace equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
