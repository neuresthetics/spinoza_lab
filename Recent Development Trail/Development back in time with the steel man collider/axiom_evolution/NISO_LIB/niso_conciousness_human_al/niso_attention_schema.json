  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Attention Schema Theory (AST) across scales capture structural equivalences in attention models, body schema analogies, control mechanisms, subjective awareness, social predictions, illusory constructs, and neural implementations—mappings where awareness models preserve control invariances invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural attention models (recursive schemas for consciousness) and aesthetic control (joyful adequacy through modeled striving) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical awareness; tetralemma probes resolve apparent illusions (affirm model/deny reality/both in neuresthetic schemas/neither dissolved in control equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
