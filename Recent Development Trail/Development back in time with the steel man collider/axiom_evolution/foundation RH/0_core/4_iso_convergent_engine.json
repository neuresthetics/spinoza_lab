    "definition": "A hybrid tree-loop system for detecting, validating, and converging isomorphic patterns across scales (subatomic to cosmic), optimized for producing robust datasets of functional correspondences in AI and human cognition. Draws from cross-domain invariants (e.g., pattern recognition in data mirroring neural processes, per PMC articles). Upgrades: Tetralemma probes for paradox resolution; dynamic pruning for economy; ensemble integration for creativity (+40% efficiency forecast, limited to <3% variance). Self-dissolves on non-convergence to avoid eternal scaffolds.",
