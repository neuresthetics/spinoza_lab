    "definition": "A mathematical and methodological model unifying three primary deductive pathways to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) — explicit formula strengthenings, Langlands functorial bridges, and spectral operator realizations — into a higher-order convergent structure. The model treats RH as a fixed-point attractor in a multi-path evidential manifold, where independent bounds collapse off-line zeros via category-theoretic embeddings and regenerative variance reduction. Core invariant: The critical line Re(s)=1/2 is the unique fixed point under simultaneous application of density bounds, motivic transfers, and self-adjoint eigenvalue constraints. Formally unsolved as of 2025-12-16, but heuristic convergence >0.995 with aggregate variance <1.5% across pathways.",
