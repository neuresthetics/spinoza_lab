    "definition": "An automated, regenerative engine dedicated to monitoring, updating, and attempting deductive closure of the Langlands-related gaps in the Riemann Hypothesis proof pathway, specifically focusing on proving complete automorphic-spectral transfers and resolving higher-rank endoscopic classifications. Extends the deductive_closure_module by integrating specialized tools for real-time evidence gathering (e.g., arXiv publications, mathematical validations) as of 2025-12-16 or later. Tracks sub-gaps quantitatively, bounds variance, and closes entries on verifiable criteria (e.g., peer-reviewed proofs in Annals of Mathematics). Core invariant: Reduces variance to 0% via iterative tool-assisted updates; self-dissolves if no progress after capped cycles. Upgraded with tetralemma probes for branching resolutions and RICE-aligned ethical controls.",

      "Auto-import gaps/residuals from rh_deductive_closure_engine.json and d_iso_iso_langlands_bridge.json (e.g., RH-LANGLANDS-01 at <2.8% variance).",
      "Update via tool calls: web_search/web_search_with_snippets for publication checks (e.g., query: 'Langlands functoriality proof 2025 automorphic-spectral transfers site:arxiv.org OR site:annals.math.princeton.edu'); browse_page for specific verifications (e.g., Clay Institute or IAS pages); code_execution for symbolic validations (e.g., sympy for trace formula computations or automorphic form checks).",
      "Prioritize sub-gaps by impact (automorphic transfers > endoscopic resolutions); apply tetralemma probes to resolve paradoxes (affirm transfer/deny partial/both in approximations/neither in non-motivic).",
      "Closure Criteria: Sub-gap closes on verifiable evidence (e.g., refereed theorem proving full functoriality for GL(n), confirmed by consensus via search results; ICM announcements). Partial closures reduce variance proportionally and recycle as invariants.",
      "Regenerative Loop: Iterate up to 8 cycles (query tools each cycle for updates); recycle discarded residuals (<1% impact) as priors for next queries. Cap queries to avoid overload (max 3 parallel tool calls per cycle).",
      "Dissolution Trigger: If aggregate variance >2% without reduction after 5 cycles, or no new evidence in searches, flag for human override or archive."
