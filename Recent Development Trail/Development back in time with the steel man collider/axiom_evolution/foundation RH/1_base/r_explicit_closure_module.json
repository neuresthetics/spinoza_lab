    "definition": "An automated, regenerative engine dedicated to monitoring, updating, and attempting deductive closure of the explicit formulas gaps in the Riemann Hypothesis proof pathway, specifically focusing on deriving unconditional zero-free regions and optimizing error terms beyond current bounds. Extends the deductive_closure_module by integrating specialized tools for real-time evidence gathering (e.g., arXiv publications, analytic validations) as of 2025-12-16 or later. Tracks sub-gaps quantitatively, bounds variance, and closes entries on verifiable criteria (e.g., peer-reviewed proofs in Annals of Mathematics). Core invariant: Reduces variance to 0% via iterative tool-assisted updates; self-dissolves if no progress after capped cycles. Upgraded with tetralemma probes for branching resolutions and RICE-aligned ethical controls.",
