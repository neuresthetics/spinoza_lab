    "definition": "A persistent, regenerative log module that tracks open deductive gaps toward a rigorous proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (or any target conjecture). It functions as a living ledger: identifying, prioritizing, bounding, and progressively closing gaps via explicit deductive requirements. Gaps are exported from other modules (e.g., residuals from iso_ files, tetralemma unresolved branches, collider flags). As we 'surf' iteratively, new evidence (tool outputs, calculations, insights) updates entries—closing them when deductive criteria are met, recycling closed gaps as proven invariants/fuel for higher convergences. Core invariant: Progress is measured by reduction in open-gap variance toward a fixed-point deductive manifold (target: 100% closure = rigorous proof). Upgraded with tetralemma status probes and RICE-aligned ratification hooks.",
    "handling_rules": [
      "Auto-import residuals/gaps from all iso_/meta modules and collider ledger (e.g., <3% speculative transfers flagged for export).",
      "Update via explicit inputs: tool calls (code_execution for verifications), human ratification, or framework iterations.",
      "Prioritize gaps by impact (e.g., Langlands bridge highest); bound uncertainty quantitatively.",
      "Closure criteria: Deductive step must be verifiable (e.g., theorem publication link, code-verified lemma, peer consensus). Partial closures recycle as sub-invariants.",
      "Regenerative export: Closed gaps fuel meta-convergence (e.g., new invariants); persistent open gaps sharpen future searches/calculations.",
      "Dissolution trigger: If variance >5% without progress (capped cycles), flag for human override or archive.",
