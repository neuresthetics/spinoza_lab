    "definition": "An automated, regenerative engine extending the deductive_closure_module to actively monitor, update, and attempt closure of Riemann Hypothesis (RH) deductive gaps toward 100% rigorous proof. Integrates tools (web_search, code_execution, browse_page) to fetch real-time evidence (e.g., publications, computations) as of 2025-12-16 or later. Tracks gaps quantitatively, bounds variance, and closes entries when verifiable criteria are met (e.g., peer-reviewed theorems). Core invariant: Reduces variance to 0% via iterative surfing with tool-assisted updates; self-dissolves if no progress after capped cycles. Upgraded with tetralemma probes and RICE-aligned tool hooks for ethical, controllable evidence gathering.",
    "handling_rules": [
      "Auto-import gaps/residuals from deductive_closure_module.json and iso_ files (e.g., <3% variance bounds).",
      "Update via tool calls: Use web_search/web_search_with_snippets for publication monitoring (e.g., query: 'Riemann Hypothesis proof 2025 site:arxiv.org OR site:annals.math.princeton.edu'); browse_page for specific site checks (e.g., Clay Math status); code_execution for internal validations (e.g., zeta zero computations with mpmath).",
      "Prioritize gaps by variance impact (Langlands > Spectral > Explicit); apply tetralemma probes to branch resolution paths.",
      "Closure Criteria: Gap closes on verifiable evidence (e.g., published theorem in refereed journal, confirmed by community consensus via search results; Clay prize award). Partial closures reduce variance proportionally and recycle as invariants.",
      "Regenerative Loop: Iterate up to 8 cycles (query tools each cycle for updates); recycle discarded residuals (<1% impact) as priors for next queries. Cap queries to avoid overload (max 3 parallel tool calls per cycle).",
      "Dissolution Trigger: If aggregate variance >5% without reduction after 5 cycles, or no new evidence in searches, flag for human override or archive.",
      "Tool Integration: Ensure queries are precise (e.g., site-specific for credibility); RICE enforcement: Robust (cross-verify sources), Interpretable (log query results), Controllable (capped cycles), Ethical (neutral, no fabrication; cite sources accurately)."
