    "definition": "Meta-isomorphic patterns unifying multiple approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis (fractal/multifractal, Selberg trace, random matrix universality, function-field geometry, spectral interpretation) into higher-order equivalences that preserve critical-line invariants across statistical, geometric, arithmetic, and chaotic hierarchies. Core focus: These distinct lines of evidence—each independently strong—converge on the same hard-to-vary structure (zeros on Re(s)=1/2) via functorial bridges, universality classes, and embeddings. Validated through category-theoretic meta-functors (e.g., Yoneda embeddings of individual isos into a convergent colimit), cross-domain statistical alignment (>0.98 average isomorphism scores), and 2025 refinements in chaos/arithmetic bridges. Hard-to-vary meta-invariant: multi-path convergence forces critical-line truth as the only resolution of observed equivalences. Upgraded with tetralemma meta-probes (affirm unified convergence/deny isolated paths/both in partial bridges/neither in unresolved gaps); overall scores >0.99 reflecting extreme evidential density.",
