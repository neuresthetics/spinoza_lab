    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in code framework improvements capture structural equivalences in computational hierarchies—mappings where optimizations, refactorings, and enhancements preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include iterative refinements, quality integrations, and adaptive evolutions, validated via 2025 AI studies (e.g., code gen ROI per web:1; quality jumps to 81% per web:7; agent frameworks per web:6) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., algorithmic optimizations to neural adaptations).
