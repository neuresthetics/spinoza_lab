    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on nature and cosmic extension (extending Spinoza's Ethics to universal scales) capture structural equivalences in ontological hierarchies—mappings where infinite modes, extended attributes, cosmic expressions, and eternal integrations preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal infinities, attribute extensions, universal determinisms, and cosmic necessities vs. finite contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., Spinoza's infinite modes in cosmic fields per web:2/7; modal metaphysics extensions per web:3/4) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., quantum extensions to planetary modes per web:6/8). Hard-to-vary invariants like infinite persistence enable forecasts of unified cosmologies; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm infinite extension/deny finitude/both in cosmologies/neither in voids); scores >0.98 based on 2025 ontological abstractions.",
