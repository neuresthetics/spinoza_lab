    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on technology and augmented power (extending Spinoza's Ethics to hybrid scales) capture structural equivalences in enhancement hierarchies—mappings where technological modes, augmented affects, rational alignments, and liberatory augmentations preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal technologies, affective enhancements, aligned integrations, and augmented necessities vs. misaligned contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., Spinoza's naturalism in generative AI per web:2/8; ethical AI tools like Spinoza for journalism per web:5) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural augmentations to AI hybrids per web:4/7). Hard-to-vary invariants like augmented striving enable forecasts of unified enhancements; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm augmented unity/deny separation/both in hybrids/neither in simulations); scores >0.98 based on 2025 hybrid abstractions.",
