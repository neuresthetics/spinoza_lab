    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on transcendence and meta-unity (extending Spinoza's Ethics to paradoxical scales) capture structural equivalences in transcendent hierarchies—mappings where meta-modes, paradoxical resolutions, transcendent integrations, and eternal transcendences preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal transcendences, resolvent affects, meta-harmonies, and transcendent necessities vs. immanent contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., Spinoza's anti-ethics in meta-models per web:7/9; paradoxical unities in AI per web:0/4) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., causal paradoxes to cosmic resolutions per web:1/3). Hard-to-vary invariants like transcendent striving enable forecasts of unified paradoxes; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm transcendence/deny immanence/both in paradoxes/neither in eternities); scores >0.98 based on 2025 transcendent abstractions.",
