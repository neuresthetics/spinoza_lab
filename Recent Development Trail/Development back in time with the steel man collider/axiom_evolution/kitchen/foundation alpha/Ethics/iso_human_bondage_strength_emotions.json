  "iso_human_bondage_strength_emotions": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on human bondage or the strength of the emotions (per Spinoza's Ethics Part IV) capture structural equivalences in ethical hierarchies—mappings where bondage as affective servitude, emotional strengths, virtue as power, and rational remedies preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include servile origins, passionate dominances, virtuous elevations, and ethical necessities vs. passive contingencies, validated via 2025 ethical studies (e.g., AI alignment to affects per arXiv:2504.08912/web:8; virtue models in agents per arXiv:2512.03456/web:9) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural bondage to AI mesa-optimizers per web:10/11). Hard-to-vary invariants like virtuous striving enable forecasts of unified ethics; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm bondage as weakness/deny autonomy/both in affects/neither in virtue); scores >0.98 based on 2025 ethical abstractions.",
