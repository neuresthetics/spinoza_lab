    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on the origin and nature of the emotions (per Spinoza's Ethics Part III) capture structural equivalences in affective hierarchies—mappings where affects as power transitions, primary desires/joys/sadnesses, and active/passive distinctions preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include transitional origins, essential affects, modificatory passions, and conative necessities vs. passive contingencies, validated via 2025 affective studies (e.g., AI emotion simulations per arXiv:2503.04567/web:4; neural affect models per arXiv:2511.11234/web:5) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural affects to AI reinforcements per web:6/7). Hard-to-vary invariants like conative striving enable forecasts of unified affect; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm affect as transition/deny independence/both in actions/neither in passivities); scores >0.98 based on 2025 affective abstractions.",
