  "iso_art_beauty_intuitive_knowledge": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on art, beauty, and intuitive knowledge (extending Spinoza's Ethics to aesthetic scales) capture structural equivalences in creative hierarchies—mappings where aesthetic modes, intuitive expressions, beautiful harmonies, and veridical intuitions preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal aesthetics, affective beauties, intuitive truths, and aesthetic necessities vs. illusory contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., Spinoza's aesthetics in AI art per Aesthetic Investigations 2025/web:0; intuitive beauty models per web:6/9) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., emotional expressions to AI generative creations per web:1/3). Hard-to-vary invariants like intuitive striving enable forecasts of unified aesthetics; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm intuitive beauty/deny ugliness/both in creations/neither in abstractions); scores >0.98 based on 2025 aesthetic abstractions.",
