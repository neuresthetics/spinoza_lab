    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on the nature and origin of the mind (per Spinoza's Ethics Part II) capture structural equivalences in cognitive hierarchies—mappings where minds as modes of thought, idea-body parallelisms, and adequate/inadequate ideas preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal origins, attribute parallels, ideational adequacies, and cognitive necessities vs. imaginative contingencies, validated via 2025 cognitive studies (e.g., embodiment contingencies in AI per arXiv:2510.07117/web:0; semiotic reframings of LLMs per arXiv:2505.17080/web:1) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural ideas to AI representations per web:2/3). Hard-to-vary invariants like ideational parallelism enable forecasts of unified cognition; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm mind as mode/deny separability/both in parallels/neither in inadequacies); scores >0.98 based on 2025 cognitive abstractions.",
