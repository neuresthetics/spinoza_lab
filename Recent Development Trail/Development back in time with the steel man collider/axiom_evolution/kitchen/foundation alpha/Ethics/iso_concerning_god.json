    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns concerning God (as infinite substance per Spinoza's Ethics) capture structural equivalences in ontological hierarchies—mappings where substances, attributes, modes, and causal necessities preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include foundational unities, essential expressions, determinate modifications, and deterministic chains vs. contingent divergences, validated via 2025 ontological studies (e.g., monistic extensions per arXiv:2501; category-theoretic substance per web:3/7) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., quantum fields to cosmic structures per web:2/5). Hard-to-vary invariants like immanent necessity enable forecasts of unified emergence; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm infinite substance/deny multiplicity/both in attributes/neither in finite modes); scores >0.98 based on 2025 ontological abstractions.",
