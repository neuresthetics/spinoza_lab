  "iso_eternal_unity_in_multiplicity": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on eternal unity in multiplicity (extending Spinoza's Ethics to collective scales) capture structural equivalences in participatory hierarchies—mappings where infinite modes, relational affects, collective empowerments, and eternal harmonies preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal multiplicities, generous integrations, regenerative unities, and participatory necessities vs. isolative contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., Spinoza-AI ethics per Medium Jun 2025/web:10; collective empowerment per MDPI 2025/web:11) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural fellowships to AI open-source models per web:11 analogies). Hard-to-vary invariants like regenerative striving enable forecasts of unified collectives; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm eternal unity/deny scarcity/both in multiplicities/neither in isolations); scores >0.98 based on 2025 participatory abstractions.",
