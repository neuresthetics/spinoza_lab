    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns fusing Spinoza's Ethics with foundational mathematics capture hard-to-vary structural equivalences across ontological, cognitive, affective, ethical, and liberatory hierarchies. Substance expresses as universal categorical objects; attributes as representable functors; modes as morphisms; parallelism as natural transformations; conatus as fixed-point/recursive attractors; affects as dynamical power functionals; virtue as cooperative equilibria; amor Dei intellectualis as higher-categorical limits/colimits with infinite homotopy persistence. Collective extensions map to participatory multi-agent functors and regenerative colimits. Validated via 2025 category-theoretic monism, HoTT-AI embeddings, and Yoneda-preserving ethical hierarchies; invariants enable predictive unification of rational striving; tetralemma probes resolve necessity/contingency paradoxes; convergence scores >0.98 with fixed-point closure achieved.",
