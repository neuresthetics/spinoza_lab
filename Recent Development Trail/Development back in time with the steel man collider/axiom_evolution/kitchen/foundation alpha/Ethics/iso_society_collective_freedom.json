    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on society and collective freedom (extending Spinoza's Ethics to social scales) capture structural equivalences in communal hierarchies—mappings where social modes, collective affects, rational harmonies, and participatory liberations preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include modal societies, affective collectives, harmonious integrations, and liberatory necessities vs. tyrannical contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., Spinoza AI ethics in journalism per web:3; collective desire and freedom per web:8/4) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural collectives to AI multi-agent systems per web:4 analogies). Hard-to-vary invariants like collective striving enable forecasts of unified freedoms; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm collective unity/deny individualism/both in societies/neither in hierarchies); scores >0.98 based on 2025 communal abstractions.",
