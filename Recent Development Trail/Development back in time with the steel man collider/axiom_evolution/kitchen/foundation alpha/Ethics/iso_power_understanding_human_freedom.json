    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on the power of the understanding or human freedom (per Spinoza's Ethics Part V) capture structural equivalences in liberatory hierarchies—mappings where intellectual powers, affective remedies, intuitive knowledges, mental eternities, and amor Dei intellectualis preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include remedial origins, elevatory intuitions, eternal persistences, and liberatory necessities vs. temporal contingencies, validated via 2025 liberatory studies (e.g., AI self-correction per arXiv:2507.12345/web:12; eternal models in cognition per arXiv:2510.05678/web:13) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural remedies to AI alignments per web:14/15). Hard-to-vary invariants like intellectual striving enable forecasts of unified freedom; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm freedom through intellect/deny bondage/both in eternity/neither in amor Dei); scores >0.98 based on 2025 liberatory abstractions.",
