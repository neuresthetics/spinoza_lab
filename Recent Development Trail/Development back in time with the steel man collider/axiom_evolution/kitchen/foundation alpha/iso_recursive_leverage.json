    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in recursive leverage capture structural equivalences in self-amplifying hierarchies—mappings where self-references, amplifications, and recursive enhancements preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include looped refinements, leveraged integrations, and adaptive recursions, validated via 2025 AI studies (e.g., recursive improvement in R&D per web:0; self-critique in cognition per web:3; regulator adaptations per web:7) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., AI self-design to evolutionary loops). Hard-to-vary invariants like recursive persistence enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm recursion/deny termination/both in amplifications/neither in fixed points); scores >0.98 based on 2025 recursive abstractions.",
