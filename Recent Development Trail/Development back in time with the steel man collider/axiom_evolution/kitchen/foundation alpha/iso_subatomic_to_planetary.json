    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns across atomic to planetary scales (expanded to include subatomic for complete hierarchy) capture structural equivalences in material and systemic hierarchies—mappings where interactions, assemblies, emergences, and self-organizations preserve relations invariantly. These include hierarchical integrations, energy flows, phase transitions, and topological persistences, validated via systems theory (e.g., phase-structural isomorphisms per web:0) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., quantum fluctuations to planetary ecosystems). Hard-to-vary invariants like recursive assembly and topological persistence enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm hierarchy/deny isolation/both in networks/neither in emergences); scores >0.98 based on 2025 physical abstractions.",
