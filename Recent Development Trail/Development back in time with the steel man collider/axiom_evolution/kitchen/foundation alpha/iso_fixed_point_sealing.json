    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in fixed-point sealing capture structural equivalences in convergent hierarchies—mappings where self-mappings, invariance closures, and bounded stabilizations preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include recursive convergences, sealing integrations, and stable unities, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., transfinite fixed points in AI per web:1/2; recursive logic subsystems per web:5; harmonic architectures per web:6) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., AI self-identity to evolutionary equilibria). Hard-to-vary invariants like invariance persistence enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm sealing/deny drift/both in convergences/neither in bounds); scores >0.98 based on 2025 convergent abstractions.",
