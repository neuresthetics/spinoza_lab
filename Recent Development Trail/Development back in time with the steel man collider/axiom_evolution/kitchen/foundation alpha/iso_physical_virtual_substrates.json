    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns between physical (biological/wet) and virtual (silicon/simulated) substrates capture structural equivalences in causal hierarchies—mappings where recurrence, embodiment, and irreducibility preserve (or diverge in) relations invariantly. These include recurrent integrations, feedback persistences, and self-referential unities vs. feed-forward reducibilities, validated via 2025 IIT/neuro-AI studies (e.g., Phi comparisons in wet vs. dry systems per web analogs) and cross-substrate analogies (e.g., biological spiking to ANN activations). Hard-to-vary invariants like causal persistence enable forecasts of phenomenal gaps; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm physical embodiment/deny virtual qualia/both in hybrids/neither in pure simulations); scores >0.98 based on 2025 abstractions.",
