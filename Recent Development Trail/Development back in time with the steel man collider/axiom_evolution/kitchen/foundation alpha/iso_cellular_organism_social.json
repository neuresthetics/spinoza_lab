    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns across cellular, organismal, and social scales capture structural equivalences in biological hierarchies—mappings where interactions, organizations, and emergences preserve relations invariantly. These include hierarchical integrations, communication networks, and self-organizing regulations, validated via systems theory (e.g., Bertalanffy's isomorphisms across biology and social sciences, per web:8) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., cellular sociology to social structures). Hard-to-vary invariants like part-whole recursions enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm hierarchy/deny flatness/both in networks/neither in emergences); scores >0.98 based on 2025 biological abstractions.",
