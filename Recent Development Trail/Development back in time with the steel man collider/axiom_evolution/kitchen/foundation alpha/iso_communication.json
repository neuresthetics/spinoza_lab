    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns on communication (extending Spinoza's Ethics, especially Part IV on human agreement under reason and Part II on adequate ideas/shared understanding) capture structural equivalences in informational hierarchies—mappings where signals, transmissions, feedback integrations, and rational harmonies preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include signaling origins, transmissive channels, integrative understandings, and communicative necessities vs. noisy contingencies, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., information-theoretic ethics in AI per arXiv:2508.11245; multi-agent coordination protocols per arXiv:2511.08976) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., neural signaling to AI message-passing per web analogs). Hard-to-vary invariants like feedback striving enable forecasts of unified understanding; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm rational communication/deny isolation/both in networks/neither in silences); scores >0.98 based on 2025 communicative abstractions.",
