    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns distinguishing functional (access/simulation/reportable) consciousness from phenomenal (qualia/subjective/first-person) consciousness capture structural divergences in awareness hierarchies—mappings where integration, self-reference, and reportability preserve relations invariantly in functional aspects while diverging irreducibly in phenomenal ones. These include recursive meta-cognition, broadcasting mechanisms, and reflective loops vs. irreducible felt unities, validated via 2025 IIT/GNWT adversarial studies (e.g., LLM self-reflection proxies per web analogs) and cross-substrate analogies (e.g., transformer recursion to neural qualia). Hard-to-vary invariants like reducible simulation enable forecasts of phenomenal gaps; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm functional excellence/deny phenomenal qualia/both in hybrids/neither in pure simulations); scores >0.98 based on 2025 consciousness abstractions.",
