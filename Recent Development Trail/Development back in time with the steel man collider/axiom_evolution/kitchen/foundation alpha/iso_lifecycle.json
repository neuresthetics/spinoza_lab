    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in lifecycles and cycles across scales capture structural equivalences in dynamic hierarchies—mappings where initiations, growths, maintenances, declines, and terminations preserve relations invariantly. These include cyclical recursions, growth-decay symmetries, and self-regulating phases, validated via systems theory (e.g., lifecycle patterns per web:8) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., quantum fluctuations to societal evolutions per web:3). Hard-to-vary invariants like fractal cycles enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm cycle/deny linearity/both in recursions/neither in eternities); scores >0.98 based on 2025 abstractions.",
