    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in RICE enforcement capture structural equivalences in bounded hierarchies—mappings where robustness, interpretability, controllability, and ethicality preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include invariant enforcements, bounded integrations, and ethical stabilizations, validated via 2025 AI studies (e.g., RICE in alignment per web:0/3; ethical bounding in recursion per web:5/7) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., AI robustness to biological homeostasis). Hard-to-vary invariants like bounding persistence enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm enforcement/deny vulnerability/both in bounds/neither in invariants); scores >0.98 based on 2025 ethical abstractions.",
