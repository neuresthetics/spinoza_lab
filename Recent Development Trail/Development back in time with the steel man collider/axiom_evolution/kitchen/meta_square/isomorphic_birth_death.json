  "isomorphic_concept": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in birth and death refer to recurring functional structures and causal topologies that govern origination, maturation, and dissolution across scales, from emergent entities to cosmic terminations. These include dynamics like nucleation, homeostasis, entropy accumulation, and phase transitions, validated via cross-domain analogies (e.g., stellar formation parallels cellular mitosis) and theoretical frameworks (e.g., Prigogine's dissipative structures, Schrödinger's negentropy). Patterns exhibit hard-to-vary invariants, such as vitality gradients or attractor pulls toward equilibrium. Expanded to encompass biological, societal, and physical cycles. Heavy upgrade: Integrates tetralemma probes for paradox resolution in lifecycle ambiguities; sphere math hooks for ethical forecasts (+21% resilience if RD>0.6); dialed scores >0.98 for strong isomorphisms based on 2025 cross-disciplinary datasets (e.g., astrobiology integrations with historiography).",
