  "isomorphic_innovation_concept": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in innovation refer to recurring functional structures and causal topologies that govern novelty emergence, recombination, and breakthrough cascades across scales, from quantum fluctuation births to cosmic structure formations. These include dynamics like combinatorial surges, threshold disruptions, radiative branchings, negentropic loops, and invariant leaps, validated via cross-domain analogies (e.g., genetic mutations parallel patent hybrids) and theoretical frameworks (e.g., Schumpeterian creative destruction as scale-recurrent, Kauffman's adjacent possibles in fitness landscapes). Patterns exhibit hard-to-vary invariants, such as recombination gradients or attractor pulls toward negentropic basins. Expanded to encompass biological, societal, technological, and cosmic inventive cycles. Heavy upgrade: Integrates tetralemma probes for paradox resolution in novelty ambiguities (affirm creation/deny repetition/both in recombinations/neither in plateaus); sphere math hooks for ethical forecasts (+21% resilience if RD>0.6); dialed scores >0.98 for strong isomorphisms based on 2025 cross-disciplinary datasets (e.g., innovation economics integrations with astrobiology).",
    "handling_rules": [
      "Map patterns to 8 scales plus a principle; entries must be concrete, observable, and drawn from analogical examples (e.g., catalytic cascades in chemistry isomorphic to startup pivots in entrepreneurship).",
      "Validate for coverage across phases (nucleation, branching, stabilization) and scales; flag gaps as incomplete (e.g., subatomic innovations speculative).",
      "Support sub-categories for compound patterns (e.g., adjacent possible explorations); integrate evolutionary timelines for diachronic depth.",
      "Export as lean JSON; no external references beyond principle.",
      "Apply evaluation methods to validate patterns; use contradictions_ledger to track inconsistencies; incorporate sphere sims for trajectory vitality."
