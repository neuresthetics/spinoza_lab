      "core_principle": "The Axiomatic Joining Function is the procedure that integrates Dialectical Unification with Fixed-Point Synthesis to receive two collided meta-geometric arguments (from Base Collider outputs) as inputs and output a unified axiomatic system representing their resolved synthesis as a singular, hard-to-vary geometric manifold. It errs toward maximal resolution of frictions into emergent unities, proliferating only those derivations that achieve invariance under isolated collider evaluation, while cataloging residual tensions for terminal dissolution if unresolvable. Heavy upgrade: Integrates tetralemma probes for paradox resolution in tensions; conatus sim hooks for ethical forecasts (+21% resilience if RD>0.6); dialed veto thresholds (≥4/5 survival) and residuals <3% for fixed-point seal.",
      "meta_axioms": {
        "J1_Unification_Primacy": "Unifications are built only by mapping resolutions across inputs via iterative synthesis (deconstruct residual frictions to shared necessities via cross-recursive 5-Whys) and geometric reconstruction (overlay resolved definitions, axioms, and proof unifications into a singular deductive order).",
        "J2_Synthetic_Recursion": "A unified system is sealed only when it is a fixed point under self-collision and isolated evaluation by the Steelman Collider, verifying fidelity to both inputs and exhaustive coverage of all resolvable alignments, prioritizing emergent unities that survive ≥4/5 veto threshold for hardness-to-vary.",
        "J3_Tension_Resolution_Fidelity": "Residual tensions from input collisions are resolved into higher unities where possible, explicitly unified, and subjected to isolated collider proliferation; unresolvable frictions must be cataloged as dissolution triggers, treating them as ethical expiry markers without forced harmony unless inherent to the fixed point.",
        "J4_Minimal_Proliferation_Imperative": "Generate only derivations, branches, and sub-structures that achieve synthetic invariance, culling peripherals via collider veto to minimize vary-ability; overgenerate provisionally for evaluation, truncate at unification stability and collider clearance."

Flag resolved frictions as 'Unified from Input1 D1 ↔ Input2 D2'.",
          "unified_axioms": "Singular self-evident truths synthesized from shared, complementary, and resolved divergent sets, enumerated exhaustively; include only those surviving isolated collider evaluation as 'hard-to-vary invariants', capturing nuances in a non-tensioned interpretive unity.",

Maximize depth and branching only within collider-cleared scopes; spawn sub-propositions via strict logical entailments post-validation.",

Enumerate only hard-to-vary candidates: resolve shared/complementary/divergents into invariants faithful to both essences (e.g., 'Why does axiom A1 conflict unresolvably with A2? What necessities underpin a higher unity?'). Provisional syntheses fed to isolated collider for veto.",

Pursue entailment until unification invariance, culling via isolated collider at each major branch.",

Updated: Cap at 3 recursions for efficiency per 2025 needs.",
