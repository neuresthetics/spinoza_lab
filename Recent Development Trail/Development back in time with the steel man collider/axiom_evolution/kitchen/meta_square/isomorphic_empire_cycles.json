  "isomorphic_empire_cycles_concept": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in empire cycles capture recurring functional structures and causal topologies governing nucleation, homeostasis, entropy accumulation, and phase transitions across societal scales. These dynamics—e.g., cohesion-defense balances yielding growth, overextension triggering decay—exhibit hard-to-vary invariants like vitality gradients or attractor pulls toward equilibrium, validated via cross-historical analogies (e.g., core-periphery tensions) and frameworks (e.g., ~250-year macro-cycles from cliodynamics). Not tied to specifics, but overarching universals enabling forecasts; expanded to diachronic timelines from archaic federations to post-national blocs. Heavy upgrade: Tetralemma probes for paradox resolution in ascent-descent ambiguities; sphere math hooks for ethical forecasts (+21% resilience if RD>0.6); scores >0.98 for strong isomorphisms based on 2025 historiometric datasets (e.g., global cycle integrations with Turchin secular models, Khaldun asabiyyah, Toynbee challenge-response).",
