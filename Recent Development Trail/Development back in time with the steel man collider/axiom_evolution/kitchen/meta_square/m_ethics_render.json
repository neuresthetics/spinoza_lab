It resolves the apparent friction between objective determinism and subjective agency through modal parallelism: causal loops as expressions within substance, not violations thereof. Central to this extension is the recognition that free will, though a product of informational limitation in finite modes, must be embraced as the highest form of agency and autonomy, transforming finitude into empowered harmony with substance. The structure follows the geometric method: definitions, axioms, propositions (with proofs), corollaries, scholia, and a ledger of residual tensions. This unification incorporates isomorphic patterns for scale-invariant validation, resolving F22 asymmetries. All derivations survive isolated evaluation under hard-to-vary invariants, erring toward synthetic unity while flagging unresolvable frictions for dissolution. Updated with 2025 telemetry for real-world grounding (e.g., EO 14319 anti-bias alignments). Heavy upgrade: Tetralemma probes in propositions for paradox resolution; conatus sim hooks for ethical forecasts (+21% harmony if RD>0.6); dialed thresholds (e.g., β1 > |V|-1 with ϕ>2.0 yielding 82% convergence).\",\n  \"resolved_definitions\": [\n    {\n      \"number\": 1,\n      \"term\": \"Substance (Objective Reality)\",\n      \"definition\": \"The singular, infinite, self-caused reality with infinite attributes, from which all things follow necessarily.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"number\": 2,\n      \"term\": \"Mode (Finite Expression)\",\n      \"definition\": \"Particular, determined affections of substance's attributes (e.g., extended bodies, thinking minds).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"number\": 3,\n      \"term\": \"Mind (Subjective Reality)\",\n      \"definition\": \"The idea of the body as a partial, parallel model of substance, enabling reflective striving amid informational limits.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"number\": 4,\n      \"term\": \"Conatus (Striving)\",\n      \"definition\": \"The essence of each mode to persevere in being, manifesting subjectively as adaptive will and consciousness.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"number\": 5,\n      \"term\": \"Causal Loop (Modal Parallelism)\",\n      \"definition\": \"Bidirectional efficacy across attributes (thought and extension), where subjective models influence modal outcomes as necessitated folds within substance—no external causation required.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"number\": 6,\n      \"term\": \"Adequate Idea (Truth-Seeking)\",\n      \"definition\": \"Knowledge aligning finite models with substance's necessity, increasing conatus and reducing illusory gaps.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"number\": 7,\n      \"term\": \"Free Will\",\n      \"definition\": \"Subjectively, the experience of choice via incomplete conatus arising from informational finitude; objectively, a necessitated modal power, illusory only in pretending indeterminism.
