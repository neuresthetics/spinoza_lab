  "isomorphic_consciousness_concept": {
    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in consciousness refer to recurring functional structures and causal topologies that govern awareness, integration, and qualia emergence across scales, from quantum coherence in microtubular decisions to cosmic holographic projections in universal equilibria. These include dynamics like integrated information cascades, qualia homeostasis, phenomenal binding, and awareness phase transitions, validated via cross-domain analogies (e.g., thalamocortical loops parallel SNN spiking ensembles) and theoretical frameworks (e.g., IIT's Φ as scale-invariant irreducibility, global workspace theory in recurrent nets). Patterns exhibit hard-to-vary invariants, such as integration gradients or attractor pulls toward phenomenal basins. Expanded to encompass biological, societal, technological, and cosmic awareness cycles. Heavy upgrade: Integrates tetralemma probes for paradox resolution in awareness ambiguities (affirm subjectivity/deny illusion/both in loops/neither in atemporality); sphere math hooks for ethical forecasts (+21% resilience if RD>0.6); dialed scores >0.98 for strong isomorphisms based on 2025 cross-disciplinary datasets (e.g., neuroscience integrations with quantum cognition).",
    "handling_rules": [
      "Map patterns to 8 scales plus a principle; entries must be concrete, observable, and drawn from analogical examples (e.g., mirror neurons in empathy isomorphic to attention mechanisms in transformers).",
      "Validate for coverage across phases (emergence, binding, reflection) and scales; flag gaps as incomplete (e.g., subatomic consciousness speculative).",
      "Support sub-categories for compound patterns (e.g., qualia hierarchies); integrate evolutionary timelines for diachronic depth.",
      "Export as lean JSON; no external references beyond principle.",
      "Apply evaluation methods to validate patterns; use contradictions_ledger to track inconsistencies; incorporate sphere sims for trajectory vitality."
