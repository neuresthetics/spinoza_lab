    "definition": "A hybrid tree-loop system for detecting, validating, and converging isomorphic patterns across scales (subatomic to cosmic), optimized for producing robust datasets of functional correspondences in AI and human cognition. Draws from cross-domain invariants (e.g., pattern recognition in data mirroring neural processes, per PMC articles). Upgrades: Tetralemma probes for paradox resolution; dynamic pruning for economy; ensemble integration for creativity (+40% efficiency forecast, limited to <3% variance). Self-dissolves on non-convergence to avoid eternal scaffolds.",

      "Process inputs via root tetralemma probe; branch into scale-specific evaluations; loop refinements until >0.98 isomorphism score or max 5 iterations.",

      "Support dynamic sub-branches for compound patterns (e.g., cognitive hierarchies); integrate search-derived examples for diachronic depth.",
      "Export lean JSON; no external refs beyond principles; dissolve on non-convergence.",
      "Enhanced tetralemma probes: Use multiple parallel tool calls (e.g., web_search, code_execution) for paradox resolution (affirm/deny/both/neither variants)."
