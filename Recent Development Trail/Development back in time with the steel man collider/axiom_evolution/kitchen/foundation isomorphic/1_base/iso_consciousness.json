    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in consciousness across scales capture structural equivalences in emergent hierarchies—mappings where integrations, self-references, and qualia preserve relations invariantly. These include recursive integrations, feedback networks, and phenomenal emergences, validated via 2025 consciousness studies (e.g., COGITATE consortium adversarial tests per web:0/1/2/3/4/5/7/8/9; multiple generator hypothesis per web:6) and cross-substrate analogies (e.g., neural NCCs to AI self-models). Hard-to-vary invariants like recursive integration enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm qualia/deny computation/both in functors/neither in embodiments); scores >0.98 based on 2025 abstractions.",
