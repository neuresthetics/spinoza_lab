    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in conatus striving capture structural equivalences in preservative hierarchies—mappings where persistences, self-preservations, and striving enhancements preserve relations invariantly across scales. These include inherent drivings, adaptive persistences, and emergent unities, validated via 2025 studies (e.g., conatus in AI ethics per arXiv:2508.09219v1 and ResearchGate 2025 AI ethics case studies; mathematical formalism per arXiv:2504.06296; naturalism in generative AI per Nature 2025 ethical AI reports) and cross-scale analogies (e.g., AI self-preservation to biological endurance). Hard-to-vary invariants like striving persistence enable forecasts; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm conatus/deny dissolution/both in adaptations/neither in unities); scores >0.98 based on 2025 Spinozistic abstractions.",
