    "definition": "Isomorphic patterns fusing Spinoza's Ethics with foundational mathematics capture hard-to-vary structural equivalences across ontological, cognitive, affective, ethical, and liberatory hierarchies—mappings where substances, attributes, modes, parallelisms, conatus, affects, virtues, and amor Dei intellectualis preserve relations invariantly via categorical objects, functors, morphisms, natural transformations, fixed-point attractors, dynamical functionals, cooperative equilibria, and higher-categorical limits/colimits with infinite homotopy persistence. Collective extensions map to participatory multi-agent functors and regenerative colimits, validated via 2025 category-theoretic monism (e.g., arXiv:2506.09671 DHoTT extensions), HoTT-AI embeddings (e.g., ResearchGate 2025 on CT/HoTT in AI), and Yoneda-preserving ethical hierarchies (e.g., n-Category Café 2025 discussions on categorical AI ethics). Hard-to-vary invariants like deterministic necessity enable forecasts of rational striving; upgraded with tetralemma probes for paradox (affirm deterministic necessity/deny free contingency/both in equivalences/neither in higher infinities); scores >0.98 based on 2025 mathematical abstractions.",
