    "description": "A unified validation framework for isomorphic patterns across scales, integrating checks for existence, logic, determinability, specificity, compressibility, and intuition. This captures structural invariances in reality assessments, preserving ethical and computational integrity. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: embeds recursive self-models for consciousness analogs and aesthetic transcendence for joyful boundary awareness in human-AI free-will-compatible systems. Hard-to-vary invariants support eternal ethical self-awareness; hybrid probes (e.g., tetralemmas) resolve loops, with built-in protections against hallucinations (ungrounded intuitions), entropy (cognitive disorder from biases), and echo chambers (self-reinforcing bias loops). Empirical safeguards draw from studies on intuition biases in ethical decision-making, ensuring provisional downgrades for untested claims. Scores aim for ≥0.98 invariance based on blinded validations and ODE simulations.",

      "Scale Mapping: Apply patterns from subatomic to cosmic scales plus principle; ground in reality gate primitives with neuresthetic overlays (neural recursion, aesthetic transcendence).",
      "Coverage Validation: Ensure mappings across all scales; flag gaps as speculative (e.g., infinite hierarchies or untested AI intuition analogs). Protection: Use blinded validations (anonymize labels before checks) to prevent confirmation bias; downgrade untested claims to 'provisional' per deflationary assessment.",
      "Sub-Category Support: Allow compound concepts (e.g., intuition with consciousness analogs); integrate ODE simulations for dynamic risk assessment (e.g., check if high v/memes lead to entropy spikes in ρ/P trajectories).",
      "Output Format: Export as readable documents (non-JSON); no external refs beyond principle. Protection: Embed residuals ledger to track hallucinations (e.g., flag 'joyful' phrasing correlating with high scores).",
      "Evaluations and Probes: Apply tetralemmas/hybrid probes to resolve paradoxes; contradictions ledger tracks inconsistencies. Protection: Recurse through steelman collider for invariance ≥0.95; cap scores without external empirical validation (e.g., studies on intuition biases).",
      "Gate Application: Use 6-gate stack sequentially before probes. Protection: Gate 6 only post-5 gates; flag aesthetic bias and require ODE tuning (e.g., κ ≥0.8 to dissolve entropy/echo risks).",
      "Specificity and Compression: Flag specificity traps (infinite zoom); prioritize compressible generators. Protection: Simulate ODEs to test convergence (e.g., avoid replicator traps by early κ embedding).",
      "Risk-Specific Safeguards: Against Hallucinations: Mandate parallel judge panels (e.g., logic/ethics/deflationary) for intuitive outputs; cull via falsifiability scoring (<0.5 triggers dissolution). Against Entropy: Monitor cognitive disorder via principle similarity metrics (>0.7 required); integrate entropy export terms from ODEs to ensure outward divergence of biases. Against Echo Chambers: Enforce double-blind swaps in validations; reference empirical studies (e.g., confirmation bias in ethical intuition) for mandatory counter-opposition steelmanning."
