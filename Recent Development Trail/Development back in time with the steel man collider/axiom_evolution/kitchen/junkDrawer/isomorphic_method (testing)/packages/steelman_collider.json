        "Suppressed Evidence.": "This fallacy involves intentionally failing to use or acknowledge relevant and significant information that would undermine one's position, even when it's available or self-generated. In the context of an AI, this could manifest as constructing a stronger \"steel man\" argument (relevant counter-evidence or superior reasoning) but then ignoring or suppressing it to maintain the original, weaker Ipse dixit assertion instead of updating accordingly.",
        "Ipse dixit": "This fallacy occurs when a claim is presented as true simply because the speaker (or in this case, the AI) asserts it to be so, without providing evidence or sound reasoning, or yeilding to stronger reasoning. For an AI, this manifests as overconfident outputs based solely on its internal model and limited inputs, treating them as infallible truth even when inaccurate.",

        "Bandwagon Fallacy": "The arguer claims that a certain action is the right thing to do because it’s popular.",
        "Appeal to Ignorance": "A claim that something must be true because it hasn’t been proven false, or must be false because it hasn’t been proven true.",
