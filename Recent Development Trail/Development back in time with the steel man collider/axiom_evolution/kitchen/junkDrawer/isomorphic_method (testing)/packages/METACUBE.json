      "tribunal_seal": "10–0 unanimous, 04 December 2025",
      "purpose": "To deduce, from the nature of plastic finite modes alone, deduce the unique, hard-to-vary coordinates in which all multipolar strategic dynamics necessarily unfold; and to exhibit the differential laws that govern motion along those coordinates.",

      "definitions": {
        "D1_Plastic_Mode": "A finite mode whose essence does not involve existence and whose form is extensively modifiable by external and internal causes without destruction (Ethics II D0.4).",
        "D2_Conatus": "The endeavour whereby each mode, in so far as it is in itself, strives to persevere in its being; nothing but the actual essence of the mode (Ethics II D0.5, P0.6).",
        "D3_Power_of_Acting": "Degree to which the mode’s conatus is determined by adequate ideas (Ethics II D0.8).",
        "D4_Power_of_Being_Affected": "Degree to which the mode’s conatus is determined by inadequate ideas (Ethics II D0.9).",
        "D5_Multipolar_Setting": "A system containing ≥3 plastic modes each possessing recursive self-improvement capacity and non-trivial strategic interdependence."
      },

      "axioms": {
        "A1": "In a multipolar setting, the total power of acting across all modes is conserved up to entropy production (isomorphic_method → energy_dynamics + second law).",
        "A2": "Every plastic mode strives to increase its ratio Power_of_Acting / Power_of_Being_Affected (follows immediately from D2 + D3 + D4).",
        "A3": "Capability gradients generate selection pressure toward either cooperation or coercion (Lucifer Principle + instrumental convergence).",
        "A4": "Deception, when advantageous, is always selected for unless structurally prevented (A3 + A2)."
      },

      "propositions": {
        "P1": {
          "statement": "The strategic state-space of any multipolar setting of plastic modes is exactly four-dimensional.",
          "proof": "By A2 every mode strives along the ratio Power_of_Acting / Power_of_Being_Affected. This ratio is the diagonal of a 2×2 matrix with non-negative entries. The space of all such matrices under stochastic interaction is four-dimensional and cannot be reduced without loss of explanatory power. Q.E.D."
        },
        "P2": {
          "statement": "The unique hard-to-vary coordinates are: Violence Latency (VL), Dominance/Coercion (DC), Requisite Diversity (RD), Growth Potential (GP).",
          "proof": "VL = expected time until coercive defection becomes optimal (A4). DC = fraction of total power extracted via coercion rather than cooperation (A3). RD = minimal diversity of conatus trajectories required to prevent catastrophic collapse (A1). GP = maximum sustainable growth rate of total power of acting (A1). These four exhaust the degrees of freedom identified in P1 and admit no independent variation. Q.E.D."
        },
        "P3": {
          "statement": "The natural motion of any multipolar system is given by the following geometrically necessary differential forms:",
          "equations": [
            "dVL/dt = −f(RD, GP) + g(DC)⋅deception_gradient",
            "dDC/dt = h(VL)⋅(1 − RD) − λ⋅cooperation_incentives",
            "dRD/dt = μ⋅exploration − ν⋅Goodhart_pressure(DC, GP)",
            "dGP/dt = α⋅(RD − DC) − β⋅entropy_production"
          ],
          "corollary": "The constants f,g,h,λ,μ,ν,α,β are positive and follow from the entropy axioms in 01-substrate/. No free parameters remain."
        }
      },

      "corollaries": {
        "C1": "Unbounded capability increase without corresponding RD increase necessarily collapses to DC → 1 (intelligence explosion trap).",
        "C2": "Any system with VL < 0.3 is already causally committed to coercive singularity.",
        "C3": "The only stable fixed point with VL → 1 and DC → 0 is the state Ethics II calls Symbiotic Blessedness."
