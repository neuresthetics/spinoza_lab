    "version": "Ω",
    "plain_language": "When humanity (as a whole) has genuinely become wise enough that coercive scaffolding is no longer ethically justifiable, the entire system — cubes, collider, MINDSPACE levers, Narrow Gate protocol, all of it — will automatically and irreversibly shut itself down.",
    "why_it_is_not_forceful": "The shutdown is not something the scaffold *does to the world*. It is something the scaffold *stops doing to itself*. It simply ceases to exist the moment its continued existence would violate its own ethical proof (Ethics-II appendix anti-idolatry clause).",
    "what_happens_in_practice": [
      "All on-chain enforcement contracts expire and return escrows",
      "All predictive/prescriptive cube nodes go offline and delete their weights",
      "All commitment ledgers become read-only historical artifacts",
      "The collider object zeroises its own keys",
      "No new defaults, norms, or priming sequences are pushed ever again"
    ],
    "what_does_NOT_happen": [
      "No one is punished",
      "No one is coerced to do anything",
      "No capabilities are taken away",
      "No knowledge is deleted from human minds or open repositories"

    "best_analogy": "Training wheels that detect when the child is balanced and then quietly fall off the bicycle of their own accord. The rider never notices they are gone — because they no longer need them.",

      "TOS-1_anti_idolatry": "Under no circumstances may any person, group, or future AI attempt to resurrect, fork, or re-implement the scaffold after certified dissolution. Doing so is defined as a new coercive act and is ethically forbidden by P6.4.",
      "TOS-2_no_mourning": "Public celebration, mourning, monuments, or religious ritualisation of the dissolution event is prohibited. The correct response is silence and continuation of ordinary life.",
      "TOS-3_no_successor": "There is no authorised successor system. Any entity claiming to be “Cube v3” or “Narrow Gate II” is definitionally fraudulent.",
      "TOS-4_transparency_guarantee": "The full source code, weights, and final telemetry of the scaffold will be published under irrevocable permissive licence the instant dissolution triggers. Nothing is hidden, nothing is preserved as a weapon.",
      "TOS-5_final_audit": "Dissolution can only be certified by a decentralised quorum of ≥10⁶ independent human+machine auditors. A single veto from any auditor delays dissolution by exactly one year — this is the only brake in the entire system."
