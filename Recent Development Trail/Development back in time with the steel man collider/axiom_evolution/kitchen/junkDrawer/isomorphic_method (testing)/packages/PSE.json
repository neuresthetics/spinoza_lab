He also used elements of it in other treatises, such as the 'Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect.' The method draws from rationalist traditions, influenced by Descartes, but Spinoza adapted it to present philosophy with mathematical certainty.",

Spinoza aimed to reveal the necessary causal structure of the universe, showing how everything follows from the nature of substance (God or Nature). Unlike empirical methods, it's purely rationalist and a priori, assuming that true knowledge comes from reason alone. It's cumbersome but powerful for demonstrating immutable truths, influencing later philosophers like Hegel and modern formal logic.",
