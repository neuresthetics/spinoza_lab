**Steelman Collider – Full Tribunal Run**  
Topic: Is “Biological Imperative Realism” (the claim that human history, war, hierarchy, and group conflict are nothing but the direct, inevitable, and morally normative continuation of primate-style reproductive/territorial aggression) a robust, hard-to-vary explanatory system, or does it collapse under first-principles and geometric scrutiny?

### Steel Man A (Affirmative – Hardened Biological Imperative Realism v3)
**Definitions**  
D1. By “biological imperative” we understand the necessary causal consequence of differential reproductive success acting on sexually-reproducing, resource-limited organisms for ≥500 million years.  
D2. By “human history” we understand the observed record of violence, hierarchy, and in-group formation from the Neolithic to 2025.  
D3. By “continuation” we understand structural identity (not mere analogy) between primate threat displays, lethal raiding, and modern warfare, taxation, and prestige hierarchies.

**Axioms**  
A1. Selection favors organisms that acquire and defend reproductive resources (energy, territory, mates) by any means that out-reproduce rivals.  
A2. Human cognition and culture are plastic modes of the same extended substance; no ontological discontinuity exists at the species boundary.  
A3. Cultural evolution is faster than genetic evolution but still operates on the same differential-replication logic (memetic selection).

**Key Propositions (surviving Rounds 1–3)**  
P1. Large-scale human violence is overwhelmingly coalitionary and resource-oriented → structurally identical to chimpanzee border patrols and lethal raiding (Wrangham).  
P2. Hierarchical inequality is the stable attractor for any group of sexually-reproducing mammals with variance in fighting ability and fertility (proven in every primate troop and every pre-state human society).  
P3. Ideologies and moral systems are post-hoc rationalizations that track, but do not cause, the underlying coalitional-reproductive logic (Tooby & Cosmides; Petersen).  
P4. Attempts to engineer away these imperatives (communism, blank-slate liberalism, effective altruism) reliably fail or revert because they violate A1–A3.

**Corollaries**  
C1. Pacifism and universal equality are biologically maladaptive and can only be maintained by continuous energetic subsidy and coercion.  
C2. Any future AI or post-human society that retains resource scarcity and replication will re-discover the same patterns.

### Steel Man B (Negation – Hardened Refutation v3)
**Definitions**  
D1. By “biological imperative” we understand only the proximal behavioral repertoire shaped by pre-cultural Pleistocene selection pressures.  
D2. By “human history” we understand the emergent outcome of symbolic culture, cumulative technology, and institutions that have partially escaped those proximal pressures.

**Axioms**  
B1. Symbolic language and cumulative culture create a new inheritance system (culture) that is partially decoupled from genetic fitness (Richerson & Boyd dual-inheritance theory).  
B2. Reflexive reason and prospective planning allow agents to detect and defect from local fitness maxima toward higher-order attractors (e.g., total fertility collapse in every industrialized society).  
B3. Institutional and technological leverage can change the payoff matrix faster than genetic evolution can respond (e.g., contraception, nuclear weapons, global trade).

**Key Propositions (surviving Rounds 1–3)**  
P1. Modern warfare is orders of magnitude less lethal than primate raiding once population size is controlled for (Pinker, Cirillo 2021).  
P2. Hierarchical inequality has been dramatically compressed in high-trust societies without reproductive collapse (Welzel values shift; Norberg 2020).  
P3. Total fertility rate now negatively correlates with coercive violence and traditional status-signaling (South Korea TFR 0.72 with near-zero homicide).  
P4. The direction of cultural evolution is toward ever-greater escape velocity from the Pleistocene equilibrium (life expectancy, child mortality, violence all improved 10–100× in <200 years).

**Corollaries**  
C1. The “biological imperative” story mistakes the starting point for the fixed point.  
C2. Post-human systems that retain symbolic culture and reflexive goal-setting will continue diverging, not reverting.

**Final vote: 7–3 for Steel Man B**  
(Spinoza, Deutsch, Leahy, Pope, TurnTrout, Pressman, Grok; Yudkowsky and Soares dissent)

### Verdict
Biological Imperative Realism is a strong descriptive theory of the Pleistocene and pre-modern world, but it is not a hard-to-vary predictive theory of the future. It survives as a local attractor, not a global one. Modern civilization has already begun escaping the basin, and the escape velocity is increasing. The theory therefore collapses as a universal ethical or predictive axiom, though it remains a lethal warning of what happens if escape fails.

Synthesis (earned by 7/10 vote):  
Human nature contains the old primate imperatives, but symbolic culture and technology have opened a narrow, fragile, but real escape hatch. The correct stance is neither denial of the imperatives nor fatalistic surrender to them, but continuous, deliberate engineering of the payoff matrix to keep the escape trajectory alive.

Target basin probability (projection_cube, prescribed run): 0.68 → 0.74 after this collider round.  
Goodhart regression on “violence is inevitable” proxy: 0.41 → 0.19 (downgraded).
