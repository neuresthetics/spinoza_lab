He also used elements of it in other treatises, such as the 'Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect.' The method draws from rationalist traditions, influenced by Descartes, but Spinoza adapted it to present philosophy with mathematical certainty.",

This ensures conclusions follow necessarily from premises, eliminating ambiguity and achieving demonstrative certainty, as if proving theorems about reality, God, mind, and ethics.",
        "description": "The geometric method (mos geometricus) is a formal, systematic way of philosophizing where metaphysics, ethics, and human psychology are treated as an interconnected deductive system. Spinoza aimed to reveal the necessary causal structure of the universe, showing how everything follows from the nature of substance (God or Nature). Unlike empirical methods, it's purely rationalist and a priori, assuming that true knowledge comes from reason alone. It's cumbersome but powerful for demonstrating immutable truths, influencing later philosophers like Hegel and modern formal logic.",
