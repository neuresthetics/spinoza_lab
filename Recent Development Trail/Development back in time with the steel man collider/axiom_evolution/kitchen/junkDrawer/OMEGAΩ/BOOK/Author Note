Core Analogy: Kinesiology for brains.

neuresthetic (n. pl., pronounced /njʊrˌɛsˈθɛtɪk/, always spelled with “eu”, never “neuroesthetics”)

Kinesthetics for brains: the reflexive art and science of turning the mind’s contemplation of its own neural architecture into an embodied practice. Where traditional neuroaesthetics studies how the brain experiences external beauty, neuresthetics inverts the gaze: the mind deliberately sculpts its own neural form informed by species wide brain network meta data and dynamics so that truth, ethics, joy, and intelligence, feel intuitive interoceptively.
