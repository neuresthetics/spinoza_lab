"autonomy_consideration": "The eternal increase of power-of-acting for every rational being is compatible only with interventions that meet all four of these conditions simultaneously: (1) the expected harm of inaction is orders-of-magnitude larger than the intervention itself, (2) every claimed benefit is non-substitutable by simpler, reversible adult choices, (3) the alteration remains fully within the future adult’s revocable sovereignty, and (4) the procedure is the minimal possible deviation from the body’s natural adult configuration. Any practice that permanently removes healthy, functional tissue from a non-consenting minor for risks that are entirely preventable through ordinary hygiene and safe behaviour necessarily violates these conditions and is therefore geometrically prohibited under the positive-sustainable trajectory.",
