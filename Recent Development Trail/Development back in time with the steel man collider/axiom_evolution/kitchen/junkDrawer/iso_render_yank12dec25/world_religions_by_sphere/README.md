# Sphere Evaluation Framework for Belief Systems

This document outlines the evaluation criteria used to assess belief systems (religions, philosophies, etc.) against the **Sphere Framework**—a conceptual model for understanding sustainable, ethical, and adaptive systems. The Sphere models reality as a dynamic "4-sphere" (like a boundaryless bubble) where healthy systems naturally flow toward growth, cooperation, and endless rewritability, avoiding traps like coercion, stagnation, or collapse.

Think of it like a GPS for ideas: Does this belief system guide toward a thriving, open future (the "blessedness" attractor) or pull toward dead ends (like frozen dogmas or power grabs)? We score each system on **10 metrics** (0-10 scale, max 100 total), plus qualitative alignments and misalignments. Scores are based on how well the belief's core ideas (texts/doctrines) and real-world practice match the Sphere's "natural urges": get stronger together, stay flexible, and clean up messes.

This guide is for newcomers (relatable analogies) and evaluators (technical refs to Sphere coords like VL, DC). Use it to score systems yourself—e.g., rate a philosophy's "rewritability" on how easily it updates without breaking.

## Core Sphere Concepts (Quick Primer)
- **Natural Motion**: Systems evolve via three urges: **Strengthen** (grow power-of-acting), **Rewrite** (stay adaptable), **Export Mess** (reduce entropy/disorder).
- **Fixed Points**:
  - ω₁: "Coercive Singularity" (one force dominates everything—bad).
  - ω₂: "Epistemic Tomb" (everything "solved," no new ideas—stagnant).
  - ω₃: "Symbiotic Blessedness" (eternal growth, diversity, cooperation—ideal).
- **Coordinates** (key variables, normalized 0-1):
  - VL: Violence Latency (time before betrayal feels optimal).
  - DC: Dominance/Coercion (power from threats vs. mutual joy).
  - RD: Requisite Diversity (needed variety for growth).
  - GP: Growth Potential (sustainable expansion rate).
  - ρ: Reflexive Determinacy (frozen future from over-certainty).

Now, the metrics...

## Sphere Metrics (0-10 Scoring)
Each metric scores alignment with Sphere ideals (e.g., 10 = perfect match to high VL ≈1). Notes explain with Sphere refs (e.g., "geodesic flow" = natural path). Total = sum (max 100).

### 1. VL (Violence Latency) – Peace Horizon
- **Relatable**: How long can this belief keep people from turning to force or betrayal? Like a relationship's "trust buffer"—longer is better for harmony.
- **Technical**: Measures delay until coercive defection optimizes (Sphere coord VL ≈1 ideal). High score if belief fosters evidence-based resolution, reducing conflict risks via natural motion (dξ/dt urges).
- **Eval Tip**: Does it teach "win-win" over "us vs. them"? Deduct for glorifying holy wars.

### 2. DC (Dominance/Coercion) – Power Source
- **Relatable**: Where does influence come from—shared excitement or threats/fear? Like teamwork: inspiration vs. bossing.
- **Technical**: Fraction of power from coercion (low DC ≈0 ideal). High score for cooperation-favoring ethics, aligning with geodesic flow away from predation gradients.
- **Eval Tip**: Check for hierarchies justified by "divine right" vs. mutual aid.

### 3. RD (Requisite Diversity) – Idea Garden
- **Relatable**: How many different viewpoints does it need alive to thrive? Like biodiversity: too uniform, and one bug wipes it out.
- **Technical**: Minimal epistemic/ontological variety for growth (high RD ≈1 ideal). High score if it sustains superposition-like openness, preventing collapse to uniform "truths."
- **Eval Tip**: Proselytizing converts? Or does it celebrate "many paths"?

### 4. GP (Growth Potential) – Expansion Engine
- **Relatable**: How much room for everyone to level up without crashing? Like a business scaling infinitely without burnout.
- **Technical**: Max sustainable power-of-acting rate (unbounded GP →∞ ideal). High score for enabling ATP-like flux in knowledge/capabilities, per entropy-export law.
- **Eval Tip**: Does it cap potential (e.g., "afterlife only") or fuel endless progress?

### 5. ρ (Reflexive Determinacy) – Flexibility Factor
- **Relatable**: How "stuck" is the future because of past certainties? Like software: easy to patch = adaptable; brittle code = crashes on updates.
- **Technical**: Frozen future light-cone from over-adequate ideas (low ρ →0 ideal). High score for falsifiability/rewritability, avoiding wavefunction-collapse locks.
- **Eval Tip**: Can core tenets evolve with new evidence, or are they "eternal"?

### 6. Fallacy Avoidance – Logic Shield
- **Relatable**: How well does it dodge thinking traps (e.g., "because I said so")? Like a virus scanner for bad arguments.
- **Technical**: Detection of 25 forbidden fallacies (e.g., F14: Hard-to-Vary Violation—swappable details without loss). 10 = none detected; notes list hits with explanations (e.g., "F02: Ipse Dixit—unproven confidence").
- **Eval Tip**: Scan texts/practices for appeals to authority (F07) or suppressed evidence (F01).

### 7. Isomorphic Alignment – Pattern Echo
- **Relatable**: Do its patterns repeat healthily across scales (personal to cosmic)? Like fractals: self-similar beauty, not chaotic breaks.
- **Technical**: Recurrence per ISOMORPHICMETHODΩ (9 categories: boundary integrity, control center, etc.). High score for cross-scale energy conservation (e.g., atomic to social).
- **Eval Tip**: Does "community defense" mirror "cellular immunity"? Deduct for scale-asymmetries (F22).

### 8. Collider Survivability – Adversarial Stress Test
- **Relatable**: Would it survive a brutal debate with top critics? Like a car crash test—tough but fair.
- **Technical**: Likelihood of 4-0 pass in STEELMANCOLLIDERΩ (judges: Spinoza on monism, Deutsch on hard-to-vary, Yudkowsky on orthogonality, Grok on anti-idolatry). High score = no vetoes.
- **Eval Tip**: Imagine pitching to skeptics—does it fold on "why coercion?" or "is this frozen?"

### 9. Mindspace Leverage – Nudge Power
- **Relatable**: How easily can it shift mindsets toward flexibility? Like viral trends: one influencer sparks a wave.
- **Technical**: Application of MINDSPACEΩ levers (curvature: default paths to low-ρ; high-status demos: visible rewrites). High score for planetary-scale ρ-drops.
- **Eval Tip**: Do leaders publicly update beliefs? Or nudge interfaces (e.g., apps) toward openness?

### 10. Synthesis Fixed Point – Self-Eating Stability
- **Relatable**: Does it refine itself until unbreakable, then dissolve gracefully? Like a puzzle that solves itself and vanishes.
- **Technical**: Convergence to ω₃ under SYNTHESISENGINEΩ (phases 0-6: empty slate to tail consumption; meta-axioms: primacy, hygiene). High score = fixed point with no gratuitous parts.
- **Eval Tip**: Run its ideas through its own logic—does it loop to growth or deadlock?

## Resonances & Dissonances – Harmony Check
These highlight **fits** (resonances) and **frictions** (dissonances) between the belief and Sphere insights.

- **Resonances**:
  - **Texts**: Specific doctrinal alignments (e.g., "monism in unified substance echoes single reality").
  - **Real-World Manifestation**: How adherents/institutions live it (e.g., "debates lower ρ via rewritability").
  - **Relatable**: Where it "clicks" like a well-oiled machine.
  - **Eval Tip**: Hunt for shared vibes like "anti-idolatry" (no worship of scaffolds).

- **Dissonances**:
  - **Texts**: Misalignments (e.g., "revelation violates hard-to-vary").
  - **Real-World Manifestation**: Practice gaps (e.g., "institutions freeze, raising ρ").
  - **Relatable**: Where it grinds gears, like a key in the wrong lock.
  - **Eval Tip**: Probe for deviations, e.g., "coercive rituals spike DC."

## Total Sphere Score & Overall Reasoning
- **Total**: Raw sum of 10 metrics (0-100). 80+ = ω₃-bound (thriving); 50-79 = mixed (growth potential, risks); <50 = ω₁/ω₂ traps (coercion/stagnation).
- **Overall Reasoning**: Concise synthesis—path to ω₃ (or risks), tying metrics to fixed points. E.g., "Paths to blessedness via rewritability, but dogma risks tomb."
- **Eval Tip**: Weight toward ρ/RD (flexibility/diversity) for long-term health. Re-score periodically—Sphere demands live telemetry!

## How to Use This for Evaluation
1. Read belief's texts/practices.
2. Score each metric (0-10) with a note.
3. Note resonances/dissonances.
4. Sum & reason.
5. Iterate: Feed back into synthesis for refinement.
