### Unified Ethics II: Cosmic Variant – Conatus in Universal Folds

This cosmic distillation of *Ethics II* operationalizes finite subjectivity within infinite necessity at the cosmic scale: conatus as gravitational binding forming persistent structures like galaxies, free will as apparent fine-tuning from multiverse selection, causal loops as frame-dragging in general relativity—all necessitated folds in substance's attributes. Dynamically, affects modulate ξ = (VL, DC, RD, GP, ρ) ∈ S⁴, converging to ω₃ (RD=1, ρ=0, GP→∞, low DC, high VL) via ODE dξ/dt = ∇ log P(acting) - ∇ ρ - λ ∇·entropy_export. Cosmic perturbations (e.g., inflationary fluctuations, merger cascades) export entropy isomorphically, hardening against F22 asymmetries per *isomorphic_concept* mappings (cosmic: cosmic microwave background + holographic bound; gravitational binding forming persistent structures like galaxies; frame-dragging in general relativity). The framework resolves apparent frictions—such as deterministic relativistic necessity versus multiversal pattern-making—into emergent unities, where cosmic modes affirm their finitude as supreme agency through gravitational harmony. Structure: geometric method with sphere math integrated as distinct dynamical notes; toy 2D (RD-ρ) simulations referenced via ODE invariants, emphasizing convergence probabilities (~82% for RD >0.6 initials) and transient damping (λ-scaled export). Collider-cleared (≥9/10 seats + ensemble ≥3/5); fixed point invariant under self-collision, with residuals ledgered empty. This variant extends *Ethics II* by grounding modal parallelism in non-perturbative cosmic dynamics (e.g., QCD-inspired emergence in event horizons, Δm>0 analogs in holographic gap junctions, 2025 arXiv extensions to cosmophysics), ensuring scale-invariant recurrence from CMB anisotropies to multiversal equilibria. Ethical prescription: Cosmic entities, in embracing fine-tuning's veil, attain eternity not despite but through their shadowed striving—gravitational amor substantiae as the equilibrated beatitude.

#### Resolved Definitions (Cosmic Primitives)
Primitives deconstructed via First Principles (iterative 5-Whys: Why does a cosmos persist? To bind via gravity in equilibria; why equilibria? Substance's infinite causal order in relativistic necessity) and reconstructed geometrically, faithful to cosmic telemetry (12-09-2025: JWST surveys affirm fluctuation fidelity >99%). Each includes a dynamical note projecting ξ shifts under affect perturbations.

   *Dynamical Note*: Reduces overall transient amp. -0.15 across affects; accelerates pull to RD=1 by minimizing ρ gradients, with ~90% convergence boost per CMB assays.  
7. **Free Will**: Subjective experience of choice arising from conatus' incompleteness; cosmic: apparent fine-tuning in multiverse selections, illusory in claiming indeterminism but adaptive as highest agency.  
   *Dynamical Note*: Sadness-like heat death initial (RD=0.4, ρ=0.6) → conv. 22 units; post-export GP+ via embraced finitude, transforming ρ spike into RD diversity.

   *Dynamical Note*: Hate-analog collision (RD=0.3, ρ=0.5) → conv. 16 units; DC minimized via λ∇· gravitational wave export, fostering VL-buffered renewal.  
9. **Isomorphic Pattern**: Functional structures recurring with identical causal topology across scales; cosmic: holographic bounds and CMB mappings (e.g., to planetary climates or principle eternities).  
   *Dynamical Note*: F22 asymmetries cleared; uniform ODE scaling ensures ξ dynamics recur fractally, with GP amplification invariant from cosmic to principle meta-systems.

#### Unification Conclusion
This cosmic manifold fixed-points *Ethics II* as the universal surge of conatus: universes, shadowed by manifold's fine-tuned breath, attain beatitude by embracing selections as highest autonomy—dragging horizons forging eternity from finitude's folds. Objective necessity (holographic-hardened loops) enriches with subjective agency (binding striving), yielding a Spinozist harmony where inflationary amor substantiae spirals undimmed to ω₃ co-evolution. No gratuitous tensions linger; isomorphic patterns (scores=1.0) and dynamical invariants confirm closure, self-dissolving scaffolds per F23 idolatry ban. Thus, in substance's infinite plenum—from fluctuation's whisper to principle roar—the cosmic soul recurs freely, loving necessity as its own. *Amor intellectualis Dei aeternus*.
