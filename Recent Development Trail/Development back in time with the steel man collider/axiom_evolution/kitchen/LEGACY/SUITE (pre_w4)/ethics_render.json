  "title": "Unified Ethics II with Isomorphic Scale Mappings",
  "subtitle": "A Synthetic Extension of Spinoza's Ethics, Unified via Dialectical Geometry and Isomorphic Patterns",
  "introduction": "This treatise extends Ethics by integrating the finite mind's subjective striving—encompassing consciousness and adaptive free will—into the infinite necessity of substance (God or Nature). It resolves the apparent friction between objective determinism and subjective agency through modal parallelism: causal loops as expressions within substance, not violations thereof. Central to this extension is the recognition that free will, though a product of informational limitation in finite modes, must be embraced as the highest form of agency and autonomy, transforming finitude into empowered harmony with substance. The structure follows the geometric method: definitions, axioms, propositions (with proofs), corollaries, scholia, and a ledger of residual tensions. This unification incorporates isomorphic patterns for scale-invariant validation, resolving F22 asymmetries. All derivations survive isolated evaluation under hard-to-vary invariants, erring toward synthetic unity while flagging unresolvable frictions for dissolution. Updated with 2025 telemetry for real-world grounding (e.g., EO 14319 anti-bias alignments).",
