    "executive_summary": "This report evaluates whether infant circumcision causes violence cycles, concluding affirmatively (\"true\") through deductive analysis of neurological, psychological, and cultural evidence from 2023-2025 studies. It posits the procedure as a causal factor in imprinting trauma that initiates and sustains aggression patterns, via mechanisms like ACEs and attachment disruption. Not sole cause but significant initiator in multivariate contexts. Structured geometrically for rigor, with web/X evidence for falsifiability. Key: Cortisol spikes and bond breaks correlate with elevated aggression, PTSD, and relational harm, causing cycles through imprinting and normalization. Counters addressed, evidence supports causation in chains.",

      "framing": "Infant circumcision involves nonconsensual foreskin removal, potentially causing \"violence cycles\"—intergenerational aggression via trauma.
