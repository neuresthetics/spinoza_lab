    "executive_summary": "This report examines the assertion that infant circumcision perpetuates cycles of violence, concluding affirmatively (\"true\") based on a synthesis of psychological, neurological, cultural, and ethical evidence. Drawing from recent 2023-2025 studies and expert analyses, it argues that the procedure imprints early trauma, disrupts emotional development, and normalizes harm within familial and societal structures, leading to intergenerational aggression patterns. While not a sole cause (multivariate factors like environment play roles), it contributes significantly through mechanisms like Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and attachment disruption. The report is structured deductively, inspired by Spinoza's geometric method for rigor, and incorporates web-searched evidence for falsifiability. Key findings: Trauma from circumcision correlates with heightened aggression, PTSD-like symptoms, and relational issues, perpetuating cycles via subconscious imprinting and cultural reinforcement. Counterarguments (e.g., no direct causation) are addressed, but evidence tilts toward perpetuation in supportive contexts.",
    "introduction": {
      "framing": "Infant circumcision, typically performed neonatally without consent, involves surgical removal of the foreskin for religious, cultural, or purported medical reasons. The query posits it perpetuates \"violence cycles\"—defined here as repetitive patterns of aggression, harm normalization, and intergenerational trauma transmission. Affirmative evidence stems from neurobiological impacts (e.g., cortisol spikes altering brain development) and psychological sequelae (e.g., attachment disorders leading to relational violence). This is not deterministic but probabilistic, amplified in dysfunctional households. Historical context: Originating in ancient rituals (e.g., Egyptian purity rites), it evolved into Abrahamic covenants, but modern critiques frame it as potential child abuse violating rights. 2025 data emphasizes omission from ACE frameworks understates its role in cycles.",
