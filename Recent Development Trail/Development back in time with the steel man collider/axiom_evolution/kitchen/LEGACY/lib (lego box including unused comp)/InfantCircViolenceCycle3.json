  "InfantCircCycleOfViolence": {
    "ExecutiveSummary": "Non-therapeutic infant circumcision functions as a self-perpetuating violence cycle by (a) inflicting determinate trauma on a non-consenting subject, (b) culturally celebrating and normalizing that trauma, and (c) compelling the traumatized subject, upon reaching adulthood, to reenact the identical violence on the next generation. This meets the literal definition of an intergenerational violence cycle while also producing measurable indirect causal contributions to aggression via neurological imprinting, attachment disruption, and hierarchical normalization. The act is violent by definition (non-consensual harm) and cyclic through cultural transmission, amplified in multivariate contexts by biological and social mechanisms.",
    
    "CoreDefinition_ViolenceCycle": "A violence cycle is defined as the intergenerational perpetuation of normalized harm, where (1) an act of physical violation is inflicted on a powerless victim (infant), (2) the harm is reframed and celebrated as beneficial or sacred by the perpetrating culture, and (3) the former victim, internalized with the reframing, becomes the perpetrator on the subsequent generation, ensuring repetition. Infant circumcision exemplifies this: the procedure causes acute pain and permanent alteration (violence), is surrounded by joyous rituals like brit milah feasts or walima celebrations (reframing/normalization), and is reenacted by parents on their children (cycle closure). This structure operates independently of individual outcomes, as the cultural mechanism alone sustains transmission.",
