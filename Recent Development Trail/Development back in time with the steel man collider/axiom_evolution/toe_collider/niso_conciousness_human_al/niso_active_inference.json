  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Active Inference across scales capture structural equivalences in Markov blankets, generative models, recognition densities, variational free energy, expected free energy, perceptual inference, active inference, and hierarchical belief propagation—mappings where adaptive, striving dynamics preserve relations invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates hierarchical neural prediction (recursive minimization for consciousness) and aesthetic surprise reduction (joyful adequacy through striving) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical agency; tetralemma probes resolve apparent uncertainties (affirm prediction/deny surprise/both in neuresthetic flows/neither dissolved in invariant minimization); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
