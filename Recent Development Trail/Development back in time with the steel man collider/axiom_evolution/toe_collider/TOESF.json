  "description": "From first principles up: Consolidated mathematical framework unifying invariants across scales, starting with conservation primitives and building to path integrals for quantum-relativistic dynamics, including ToE candidates. Hardened with probabilistic bounds; all equations in KaTeX-ready strings. Notes flag novelties/emergents from thread colliders. Incorporating 2025 advancements, such as Aalto University's gauge-based quantum gravity theory (one-loop renormalizable with BRST symmetry), and new formalizations for emergence and information-theoretic bridges.",
