      "name": "Recursive Steel Man Collider (Unified Dynamics Edition)",
      "version": "4.0",
      "description": "A dynamical synthesis engine that unifies Logic Gates (structure) with Motion Laws (dynamics). Unlike previous versions which relied on static recursion, this framework models argument refinement as a trajectory through phase space, governed by the maximization of coherence (Conatus) and the minimization of rigidity (Entropy Export).",

        "formula": "dξ/dt = ∇ log P(coherence) − ∇ρ(rigidity) − λ_eff ∇·entropy + κ * (1 + cos(φ (1-ρ)^2))",
        "notes": "The governing equation for refining ideas. The state (ξ) evolves by increasing logical power (P), reducing dogmatic rigidity (ρ), and exporting contradictions (entropy), modulated by humble grounding (λ_eff)."
