  "version": "1.5.0",
  "description": "Enhanced protocol for capturing multidimensional insights across research fields, incorporating systematic review best practices (e.g., GRADE, FINER, PRISMA) for improved rigor, bias mitigation, and automation. Focuses on duplication avoidance, balanced assessments, and computational hooks for effectiveness.",
  "trigger_conditions": [
    "Patterns, interactions, or overlaps not in knowledge base; justified non-duplication via registry checks (e.g., PROSPERO analogs)."
